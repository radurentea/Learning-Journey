# Notes
## SoC (System on chip)
Def:
  Microchip that integrates most or all the components of a computer or electronic system into a chip.

Devices with SoC:
  - Smartphones, Tablets, Embededded Systems and IoT Devices

An alternative to SoC is MCM.

## MCM (Multi-chip module)

Def:
  Electronic systems that are built using multiple individuals chips, each with a specific function or purpose. Better flexibility aand specialization in the design of the electronic system. More complex and more expensive to build.
  
Devices using multi-chip solutions:
  - Desktop Computers - separate chips ofr CPU, GPU, Memory and other components (all mounted on PCB)
  - Gaming Consoles - CPU, GPU, Memory and other specialized chips for video decoding and audio proccesing
  - Networking Equipment (Routers, Switches etc) - packet processing, network management etc
  - Automotive Electronics - used in multiple electronic systems: enginge control units, safety systems, infotainment systems
  - Medical Devices - MRI machines, patient monitoring systems, etc use chips for data acquisition, processing and communication


## Module

Def:
  A pre-assembled, self-contained component that typically integrates one or more specialized functionalities.It can be thought of as a building block that can be easily integrated into a larger system.
  
Modules can consist of one or more Integrated Circuits (including SoC) and other components such as passivce components, connectors, and sometimes even antennas. They are usually designed to perform a specific function or provide  a specific interface (e.g. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, or sensor modules).
