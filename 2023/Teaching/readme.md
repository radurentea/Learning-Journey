# All things about teaching

## Notes:

Teaching others is a rewarding endeavor and requires both expertise in the subject matter and a strong understanding of teaching methods. To learn about teaching, especially from a psychology and scientific perspective, you might find the following resources valuable:

1. **Books**:
   - "How Learning Works: Seven Research-Based Principles for Smart Teaching" by Susan A. Ambrose: This book offers insight into the learning process and gives you practical advice for teaching.
   - "Teaching at Its Best: A Research-Based Resource for College Instructors" by Linda B. Nilson: A comprehensive guide for teaching, especially in a higher education context.
   - "Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning" by Peter C. Brown, Henry L. Roediger III, and Mark A. McDaniel: This book focuses on cognitive psychology's insights into effective teaching and learning methods.
   - "Mindset: The New Psychology of Success" by Carol Dweck: This book can help you understand the role of mindset in learning and achievement, which is an important aspect of teaching.

2. **Online courses**:
   - "Learning to Teach Online" by the University of New South Wales on Coursera: This course will help you understand the basics of online education, including course design, digital tools, and more.
   - "The Science of Learningâ€“What Every Teacher Should Know" by the University of Pennsylvania on edX: This course introduces you to the science of how people learn.
   - "The Learning Brain" by the University of Texas at Austin on edX: This course goes in-depth into the neuroscience of learning.

3. **Scientific Journals and Websites**: 
   - "Educational Psychology Review" and "Journal of Educational Psychology" publish peer-reviewed articles on the application of psychology to education.
   - "American Educational Research Journal" publishes empirical research that covers a wide array of topics in education, including learning processes and developmental, contextual, and methodological issues.

4. **Teaching communities and blogs**:
   - "The Chronicle of Higher Education" is a source of news, information, and job listings for college and university faculty members and administrators.
   - "Edutopia" and "TeachThought" are great education blogs with lots of ideas, strategies, and resources.
   - Online communities like Reddit's /r/Teachers is a place where educators share experiences, advice, and resources.

Finally, be aware that teaching computer science and web development might require some specific strategies and resources. I recommend looking into "CS Unplugged" which provides computer science teaching resources, and "Mozilla Developer Network" which is a great resource for web development.
